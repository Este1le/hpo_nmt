<h1>Evaluation</h1>
<p>The problem is a multiobjective hyperparameter optimization problem. We want to find the best hyperparameter settings that lead to good accuracy-speed tradeoff on a given dataset.</p>
    
<p>This sample competition allows you to submit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only prediction results (no code).</li>
<li>Code that includes logic or pre-trained model for automatically sampling hyperparameter configurations</li>
</ul>
<p>The submissions are evaluated using the number of pareto solutions found after a fixed budget ("fb" metric).</p>
